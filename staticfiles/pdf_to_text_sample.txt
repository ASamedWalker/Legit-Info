fusing,  with  damaging  effects  on  voter  partici-

pation in elections and disproportionate impacts 

on  young  people,  persons  with  disabilities,  and 

racial and ethnic minorities; and

dated  with  21st  Century  technologies  and  pro-

cedures to maintain their security.

records of racial discrimination. 

(3)  There  continues  to  be  an  alarming  move-

ment  to  erect  barriers  to  make  it  more  difficult  for 

Americans  to  participate  in  our  Nation’s  democratic 

process. The Nation has witnessed unprecedented ef-

forts  to  turn  back  the  clock  and  erect  barriers  to 

voting  for  communities  of  color  which  have  faced 

historic  and  continuing  discrimination,  as  well  as 

disabled,  young,  elderly,  and  low-income  Americans. 

(4)  The  Supreme  Court’s  2013  Shelby  County 

v.  Holder  decision  gutted  decades-long  Federal  pro-

tections  for  communities  of  color  that  face  historic 

and  continuing  discrimination,  emboldening  States 

and local jurisdictions to pass voter suppression laws 

and  implement  procedures,  such  as  those  requiring 

photo  identification,  limiting  early  voting  hours, 

eliminating  same-day  registration,  purging  voters 

from  the  rolls,  and  reducing  the  number  of  polling 

places.  Congress  is  committed  to  reversing  the  dev-

astating impact of this decision.

store  the  Voting  Rights  Act  and  combat  continuing 

efforts  in  America  that  suppress  the  free  exercise  of 

the franchise in communities of color. 

(6)  The  2018  midterm  election  provides  further 

evidence  that  systemic  voter  discrimination  and  in-

timidation  continues  to  occur  in  communities  of

(A) improve access to the ballot; 

(B)  enhance  the  integrity  and  security  of

SEC. 2101. FINDINGS RELATING TO NATIVE AMERICAN VOT-

ING RIGHTS. 

Congress finds the following: 

(1)  The  right  to  vote  for  all  Americans  is  sa-

cred. Congress must fulfill the Federal Government’s 

trust  responsibility  to  protect  and  promote  Native 

Americans’  exercise  of  their  fundamental  right  to 

vote, including equal access to voter registration vot-

ing  mechanisms  and  locations,  and  the  ability  to 

serve as election officials. 

(2)  The  Native  American  Voting  Rights  Coali-

tion’s  four-State  survey  of  voter  discrimination 

(2016)  and  nine  field  hearings  in  Indian  Country 

(2017-2018)  revealed  obstacles  that  Native  Ameri-

cans  must  overcome,  including  a  lack  of  accessible 

and  proximate  registration  and  polling  sites,  non-

traditional addresses for residents on Indian reserva-

members, and voter identification laws that discrimi-

dictions  have  been  unresponsive  to  reasonable  re-

quests  from  federally  recognized  Indian  Tribes  for 

more  accessible  and  proximate  voter  registration 

sites and in-person voting locations. 

(3)  The  2018  elections  provide  further  evidence 

that  systemic  voter  discrimination  and  intimidation 

continues to occur in communities of color and Trib-

al  lands  across  the  country,  making  it  clear  that  de-

passes additional protections. 

(4)  Congress  has  broad,  plenary  authority  to 

enact  legislation  to  safeguard  the  voting  rights  of 

Native American voters.

islation to restore the Voting Rights Act and combat

within  Tribal  lands,  to  include,  but  not  to  be  limited

Subtitle C—Findings Relating to 
District of Columbia Statehood 

SEC. 2201. FINDINGS RELATING TO DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 

STATEHOOD. 

Congress finds the following: 

(1)  District  of  Columbia  residents  deserve  full 

congressional  voting  rights  and  self-government, 

which only statehood can provide. 

(2) The 700,000 residents of the District of Co-

lumbia  pay  more  Federal  taxes  per  capita  than  resi-

dents  of  any  State  in  the  country,  yet  do  not  have 

full  and  equal  representation  in  Congress  and  self- 

government. 

(3) Since the founding of the United States, the 

residents  of  the  District  of  Columbia  have  always 

carried  all  the  obligations  of  citizenship,  including 

serving  in  all  of  the  Nation’s  wars  and  paying  Fed-

eral  taxes,  all  without  voting  representation  on  the 

floor in either Chamber of Congress or freedom from 

congressional interference in purely local matters. 

(4)  There  are  no  constitutional,  historical,  fi-

nancial, or economic reasons why the 700,000 Amer-

icans who live in the District of Columbia should not 

be granted statehood.

dirty  money  derived  from  illicit  activities  such  as 

trafficking,  bribery,  exploitation,  and  embezzlement. 

Ownership  and  control  of  the  finances  that  run 

through  shell  companies  are  obscured  to  regulators 

and law enforcement because  little information  is  re-

quired and collected when establishing these entities. 

(2)  The  public  release  of  the  ‘‘Panama  Papers’’ 

in 2016 and the ‘‘Paradise Papers’’ in 2017 revealed 

that  these  shell  companies  often  purchase  and  sell 

United  States  real  estate.  United  States  anti-money 

laundering laws do not apply to cash transactions in-

volving  real  estate  effectively  concealing  the  bene-

shell  companies  for  illicit  purposes  by  requiring 

United  States  companies  to  disclose  their  beneficial 

owners,  strengthening  anti-money  laundering  and 

counter-terrorism finance laws.

SEC. 4203. FINDINGS. 

387 

Congress makes the following findings: 

(1)  On  January  6,  2017,  the  Office  of  the  Di-

rector  of  National  Intelligence  published  a  report  ti-

tled  ‘‘Assessing  Russian  Activities  and  Intentions  in 

Recent  U.S.  Elections’’,  noting  that  ‘‘Russian  Presi-

dent  Vladimir  Putin  ordered  an  influence  campaign 

in  2016  aimed  at  the  US  presidential  election  *  * 

*’’.  Moscow’s  influence  campaign  followed  a  Russian 

messaging  strategy  that  blends  covert  intelligence 

operation—such  as  cyber  activity—with  overt  efforts 

by  Russian  Government  agencies,  state-funded 

media,  third-party  intermediaries,  and  paid  social 

media users or ‘‘trolls’’. 

(2)  On  November  24,  2016,  The  Washington 

Post  reported  findings  from  2  teams  of  independent 

researchers 

that  concluded  Russians 

‘‘exploited 

American-made  technology  platforms  to  attack  U.S. 

democracy  at  a  particularly  vulnerable  moment  *  * 

*  as  part  of  a  broadly  effective  strategy  of  sowing 

distrust in U.S. democracy and its leaders.’’. 

(3) Findings from a 2017 study on the manipu-

lation  of  public  opinion  through  social  media  con-

ducted  by  the  Computational  Propaganda  Research 

Project  at  the  Oxford  Internet  Institute  found  that 

the  Kremlin  is  using  pro-Russian  bots  to  manipulate

public  discourse  to  a  highly  targeted  audience.  With 

a  sample  of  nearly  1,300,000  tweets,  researchers 

found  that  in  the  2016  election’s  3  decisive  States, 

propaganda  constituted  40  percent  of  the  sampled 

election-related  tweets  that  went  to  Pennsylvanians, 

34  percent  to  Michigan  voters,  and  30  percent  to 

those in Wisconsin. In other swing States, the figure 

reached  42  percent  in  Missouri,  41  percent  in  Flor-

ida,  40  percent  in  North  Carolina,  38  percent  in 

Colorado, and 35 percent in Ohio. 

(4)  On  September  6,  2017,  the  nation’s  largest 

social  media  platform  disclosed  that  between  June 

2015  and  May  2017,  Russian  entities  purchased 

$100,000 

in  political  advertisements,  publishing 

roughly 3,000 ads linked to fake accounts associated 

with  the  Internet  Research  Agency,  a  pro-Kremlin 

organization.  According  to  the  company,  the  ads 

purchased  focused  ‘‘on  amplifying  divisive  social  and 

political messages * * *’’. 

(5)  In  2002,  the  Bipartisan  Campaign  Reform 

Act became law, establishing disclosure requirements 

for  political  advertisements  distributed  from  a  tele-

vision  or  radio  broadcast  station  or  provider  of  cable 

or  satellite  television.  In  2003,  the  Supreme  Court 

upheld  regulations  on  electioneering  communications

established  under  the  Act,  noting  that  such  require-

ments  ‘‘provide  the  electorate  with  information  and 

insure  that  the  voters  are  fully  informed  about  the 

person or group who is speaking.’’. 

(6)  According  to  a  study  from  Borrell  Associ-

ates,  in  2016,  $1,415,000,000  was  spent  on  online 

advertising,  more  than  quadruple  the  amount  in 

2012. 

(7)  The  reach  of  a  few  large  internet  plat-

forms—larger  than  any  broadcast,  satellite,  or  cable 

provider—has greatly facilitated the scope and effec-

tiveness  of  disinformation  campaigns.  For  instance, 

the  largest  platform  has  over  210,000,000  Ameri-

cans  users—over  160,000,000  of  them  on  a  daily 

basis.  By  contrast,  the  largest  cable  television  pro-

vider  has  22,430,000  subscribers,  while  the  largest 

satellite  television  provider  has  21,000,000  sub-

scribers.  And  the  most-watched  television  broadcast 

in United States history had 118,000,000 viewers. 

(8)  The  public  nature  of  broadcast  television, 

radio,  and  satellite  ensures  a  level  of  publicity  for 

any  political  advertisement.  These  communications 

are  accessible  to  the  press,  fact-checkers,  and  polit-

ical  opponents;  this  creates  strong  disincentives  for 

a  candidate  to  disseminate  materially  false,  inflam-

matory,  or  contradictory  messages  to  the  public.  So-

cial media platforms, in contrast, can target portions 

of  the  electorate  with  direct,  ephemeral  advertise-

ments  often  on  the  basis  of  private  information  the 

platform  has  on  individuals,  enabling  political  adver-

tisements  that  are  contradictory,  racially  or  socially 

inflammatory, or materially false. 

(9)  According  to  comScore,  2  companies  own  8 

of  the  10  most  popular  smartphone  applications  as 

of  June  2017,  including  the  most  popular  social 

media  and  email  services—which  deliver  information 

and  news  to  users  without  requiring  proactivity  by 

the  user.  Those  same  2  companies  accounted  for  99 

percent of revenue growth from digital advertising in 

2016,  including  77  percent  of  gross  spending.  79 

percent  of  online  Americans—representing  68  per-

cent  of  all  Americans—use  the  single  largest  social 

network,  while  66  percent  of  these  users  are  most 

likely to get their news from that site. 

(10)  In  its  2006  rulemaking,  the  Federal  Elec-

tion  Commission  noted  that  only  18  percent  of  all 

Americans  cited  the  internet  as  their  leading  source 

of news about the 2004 Presidential election; by con-

trast,  the  Pew  Research  Center  found  that  65  per-

cent  of  Americans

source  as  their  leading  source  of  information  for  the 

2016 election. 

(11)  The  Federal  Election  Commission,  the 

independent  Federal  agency  charged  with  protecting 

the  integrity  of  the  Federal  campaign  finance  proc-

ess  by  providing  transparency  and  administering 

campaign  finance  laws,  has  failed  to  take  action  to 

address online political advertisements. 

(12)  In  testimony  before  the  Senate  Select 

Committee  on  Intelligence  titled,  ‘‘Disinformation:  A 

Primer  in  Russian  Active  Measures  and  Influence 

Campaigns’’,  multiple  expert  witnesses  testified  that 

while  the  disinformation  tactics  of  foreign  adver-

saries  have  not  necessarily  changed,  social  media 

services  now  provide  ‘‘platform[s]  practically  pur-

pose-built  for  active  measures[.]’’  Similarly,  as  Gen. 

Keith  B.  Alexander  (RET.),  the  former  Director  of 

the  National  Security  Agency,  testified,  during  the 

Cold  War  ‘‘if  the  Soviet  Union  sought  to  manipulate 

information  flow,  it  would  have  to  do  so  principally 

through  its  own  propaganda  outlets  or  through  ac-

tive  measures  that  would  generate  specific  news: 

planting  of  leaflets,  inciting  of  violence,  creation  of 

other  false  materials  and  narratives.  But  the  news

required actual control of the organs of media, which 

took  long-term  efforts  to  penetrate.  Today,  however, 

because  the  clear  majority  of  the  information  on  so-

proliferation  of  information  sources  and  other  sites 

that can reinforce information, there is an increasing 

likelihood  that  the  information  available  to  average 

consumers  may  be  inaccurate  (whether  intentionally 

or  otherwise)  and  may  be  more  easily  manipulable 

than in prior eras.’’.

ments  do  not  provide  sufficient  transparency  to  up-

hold the public’s right to be fully informed about po-

SEC. 4204. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 

It is the sense of Congress that—

vertisements,  and  the  growing  centrality  of  online 

platforms  in  the  lives  of  Americans,  requires  the 

Congress  and  the  Federal  Election  Commission  to 

take  meaningful  action  to  ensure  that  laws  and  reg-

ulations  provide  the  accountability  and  transparency 

that is fundamental to our democracy; 

(2)  free  and  fair  elections  require  both  trans-

parency  and  accountability  which  give  the  public  a

Congress finds the following: 

(1)  The  American  Republic  was  founded  on  the 

principle  that  all  people  are  created  equal,  with 

rights and responsibilities  as  citizens  to  vote,  be  rep-

resented,  speak,  debate,  and  participate  in  self-gov-

ernment  on  equal  terms  regardless  of  wealth.  To  se-

cure  these  rights  and  responsibilities,  our  Constitu-

tion  not  only  protects  the  equal  rights  of  all  Ameri-

cans  but  also  provides  checks  and  balances  to  pre-

vent  corruption  and  prevent  concentrated  power  and 

wealth from undermining effective self-government.

(2)  The  Supreme  Court’s  decisions  in  Citizens 

United  v.  Federal  Election  Commission,  558  U.S. 

310  (2010)  and  McCutcheon  v.  FEC,  572  U.S.  185 

(2014),  as  well  as  other  court  decisions,  erroneously 

invalidated  even-handed  rules  about  the  spending  of 

money  in  local,  State,  and  Federal  elections.  These 

flawed  decisions  have  empowered  large  corporations, 

extremely  wealthy  individuals,  and  special  interests 

to  dominate  election  spending,  corrupt  our  politics, 

and  degrade  our  democracy  through  tidal  waves  of 

unlimited  and  anonymous  spending.  These  decisions 

also  stand  in  contrast  to  a  long  history  of  efforts  by 

Congress  and  the  States  to  regulate  money  in  poli-

tics  to  protect  democracy,  and  they  illustrate  a  trou-

bling  deregulatory  trend  in  campaign  finance-related 

court  decisions.  Additionally,  an  unknown  amount  of 

foreign  money  continues  to  be  spent  in  our  political 

system  as  subsidiaries  of  foreign-based  corporations 

and  hostile  foreign  actors  sometimes  connected  to 

nation-States work to influence our elections. 

(3)  The  Supreme  Court’s  misinterpretation  of 

the  Constitution  to  empower  monied  interests  at  the 

expense of the American people in elections has seri-

ously  eroded  over  100  years  of  congressional  action

to  promote  fairness  and  protect  elections  from  the 

toxic influence of money. 

(4)  In  1907,  Congress  passed  the  Tillman  Act 

in  response  to  the  concentration  of  corporate  power 

in the post-Civil War Gilded Age. The Act prohibited 

corporations  from  making  contributions  in  connec-

tion  with  Federal  elections,  aiming  ‘‘not  merely  to 

prevent  the  subversion  of  the  integrity  of  the  elec-

toral  process  [but]  *  *  *  to  sustain  the  active,  alert 

responsibility  of  the  individual  citizen  in  a  democ-

racy for the wise conduct of government’’. 

(5) By 1910, Congress began passing disclosure 

requirements  and  campaign  expenditure  limits,  and 

dozens  of  States  passed  corrupt  practices  Acts  to 

prohibit  corporate  spending  in  elections.  States  also 

enacted  campaign  spending  limits,  and  some  States 

limited  the  amount  that  people  could  contribute  to 

campaigns. 

(6)  In  1947,  the  Taft-Hartley  Act  prohibited 

corporations and unions from making campaign con-

tributions  or  other  expenditures  to  influence  elec-

tions. In 1962, a Presidential commission on election 

spending  recommended  spending  limits  and  incen-

tives  to  increase  small  contributions  from  more  peo-

(7)  The  Federal  Election  Campaign  Act  of 

1971  (FECA),  as  amended  in  1974,  required  disclo-

sure of contributions and expenditures, imposed con-

tribution  and  expenditure  limits  for  individuals  and 

groups,  set  spending  limits  for  campaigns,  can-

didates,  and  groups,  implemented  a  public  funding 

system  for  Presidential  campaigns,  and  created  the 

Federal  Election  Commission  to  oversee  and  enforce 

the new rules. 

(8)  In  the  wake  of  Citizens  United  and  other 

damaging  Federal  court  decisions,  Americans  have 

witnessed  an  explosion  of  outside  spending  in  elec-

tions. Outside spending increased nearly 900 percent 

between  the  2008  and  2016  Presidential  election 

years.  Indeed,  the  2018  elections  once  again  made 

clear  the  overwhelming  political  power  of  wealthy 

special interests, to the tune of over $5,000,000,000. 

And  as  political  entities  adapt  to  a  post-  Citizens 

United,  post-McCutcheon  landscape,  these  trends  are 

getting  worse,  as  evidenced  by  the  experience  in  the 

2018  midterm  congressional  elections,  where  outside 

spending  more  than  doubled  from  the  previous  mid-

term cycle. 

(9) The torrent of money flowing into our polit-

ical  system  has  a  profound  effect  on  the  democratic

process  for  everyday  Americans,  whose  voices  and 

policy  preferences  are  increasingly  being  drowned 

out  by  those  of  wealthy  special  interests.  The  more 

campaign  cash  from  wealthy  special  interests  can 

flood our elections, the more policies that favor those 

interests  are  reflected  in  the  national  political  agen-

da.  When  it  comes  to  policy  preferences,  our  Na-

tion’s  wealthiest  tend  to  have  fundamentally  dif-

ferent  views  than  do  average  Americans  when  it 

comes to issues ranging from unemployment benefits 

to the minimum wage to health care coverage. 

(10)  The  Court  has  tied  the  hands  of  Congress 

and  the  States,  severely  restricting  them  from  set-

ting  reasonable  limits  on  campaign  spending.  For 

example,  the  Court  has  held  that  only  the  Govern-

ment’s  interest  in  preventing  quid  pro  quo  corrup-

tion,  like  bribery,  or  the  appearance  of  such  corrup-

tion,  can  justify  limits  on  campaign  contributions. 

More  broadly,  the  Court  has  severely  curtailed  at-

tempts  to  reduce  the  ability  of  the  Nation’s  wealthi-

est  and  most  powerful  to  skew  our  democracy  in 

their  favor  by  buying  outsized  influence  in  our  elec-

tions. Because this distortion of the Constitution has 

prevented  truly  meaningful  regulation  or  reform  of 

the  way  we  finance  elections  in  America,  a  constitu-

tional  amendment  is  needed  to  achieve  a  democracy 

for all the people. 

(11)  Since  the  landmark  Citizens  United  deci-

sion,  19  States  and  nearly  800  municipalities,  in-

cluding large cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chi-

cago,  and  Philadelphia,  have  gone  on  record  sup-

porting  a  constitutional  amendment.  Transcending 

political  leanings  and  geographic  location,  voters  in 

States  and  municipalities  across  the  country  that 

have  placed  amendment  questions  on  the  ballot  have 

routinely  supported  these  initiatives  by  considerably 

large margins. 

(12)  At  the  same  time  millions  of  Americans 

have signed petitions, marched, called their Members 

of  Congress,  written  letters  to  the  editor,  and  other-

wise  demonstrated  their  public  support  for  a  con-

stitutional  amendment  to  overturn  Citizens  United 

that  will  allow  Congress  to  reign  in  the  outsized  in-

fluence  of  unchecked  money  in  politics.  Dozens  of 

organizations,  representing  tens  of  millions  of  indi-

viduals,  have  come  together  in  a  shared  strategy  of 

supporting such an amendment. 

(13)  In  order  to  protect  the  integrity  of  democ-

racy and the electoral process and to ensure political 

equality  for  all,  the  Constitution  should  be  amended

serve their communities.

exist  whether  or  not  a  candidate  were  running  for 

office,  like  childcare  and  food.  While  the  law  seems 

neutral,  its  actual  effect  is  to  privilege  the  independ-

ently wealthy who want to run, because given the de-

mands  of  running  for  office,  candidates  who  must 

work  to  pay  for  childcare  or  to  afford  health  insur-

ance  are  effectively  being  left  out  of  the  process, 

even  if  they  have  sufficient  support  to  mount  a  via-

ble campaign. 

(3)  Thus  current  practice  favors  those  prospec-

tive  candidates  who  do  not  need  to  rely  on  a  regular 

paycheck  to  make  ends  meet.  The  consequence  is 

that  everyday  Americans  who  have  firsthand  knowl-

edge  of  the  importance  of  stable  childcare,  a  safety 

net,  or  great  public  schools  are  less  likely  to  get  a 

seat at the table. This governance by the few is anti-

thetical  to  the  democratic  experiment,  but  most  im-

portantly,  when  lawmakers  do  not  share  the  con-

cerns  of  everyday  Americans,  their  policies  reflect 

that. 

(4)  These  circumstances  have  contributed  to  a 

Congress  that  does  not  always  reflect  everyday 

Americans.  The  New  York  Times  reported  in  2019 

that  fewer  than  5  percent  of  representatives  cite 

blue-collar  or  service  jobs  in  their  biographies.  A

2015  survey  by  the  Center  for  Responsive  Politics 

showed that the  median  net worth of  lawmakers  was 

just  over  $1  million  in  2013,  or  18  times  the  wealth 

of the typical American household. 

(5)  These  circumstances  have  also  contributed 

to  a  governing  body  that  does  not  reflect  the  nation 

it  serves.  For  instance,  women  are  51%  of  the 

American population. Yet even with a record number 

of  women  serving  in  the  One  Hundred  Sixteenth 

Congress,  the  Pew  Research  Center  notes  that  more 

than three out of four Members of this Congress are 

male.  The  Center  for  American  Women  And  Politics 

found  that  one  third  of  women  legislators  surveyed 

had  been  actively  discouraged  from  running  for  of-

fice, often by political professionals. This type of dis-

couragement,  combined  with  the  prohibitions  on 

using  campaign  funds  for  domestic  needs 

like 

childcare,  burdens  that  still  fall  disproportionately 

on  American  women,  particularly  disadvantages 

working  mothers.  These  barriers  may  explain  why 

only  10  women  in  history  have  given  birth  while 

serving  in  Congress,  in  spite  of  the  prevalence  of 

working  parents  in  other  professions.  Yet  working 

mothers  and  fathers  are  best  positioned  to  create

policy  that  reflects  the  lived  experience  of  most 

Americans. 

(6)  Working  mothers,  those  caring  for  their  el-

derly  parents,  and  young  professionals  who  rely  on 

their  jobs  for  health  insurance  should  have  the  free-

dom  to  run  to  serve  the  people  of  the  United  States. 

Their  networks  and  net  worth  are  simply  not  the 

best  indicators  of  their  strength  as  prospective  pub-

lic  servants.  In  fact,  helping  ordinary  Americans  to 

run may create better policy for all Americans. 

(c)  PURPOSE.—It  is  the  purpose  of  this  subtitle  to 

ensure  that  all  Americans  who  are  otherwise  qualified  to 

serve  this  Nation  are  able  to  run  for  office,  regardless  of 

their  economic  status.  By  expanding  permissible  uses  of 

campaign funds and providing modest assurance that test-

ing a run for office will not cost one’s livelihood, the Help 

America Run Act will facilitate the candidacy of represent-

atives  who  more  accurately  reflect  the  experiences,  chal-

lenges, and ideals of everyday Americans.
